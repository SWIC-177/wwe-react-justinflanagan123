# WWE React

<!-- TODO: What do you think about React so far? What make sense? What connections are there to the JS fundamentals that you have learned prior to this? Reflect and personalize this! -->

#### 1. Virtual DOM

React utilizes a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM, which can be costly in terms of resources. Instead, React compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only updates the parts that have changed.

#### 2. Components

React applications are built using components, which are self-contained, reusable pieces of UI. Components can be simple, representing small UI elements like buttons or inputs, or complex, representing entire sections of a page.

#### 3. JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes React code more readable and intuitive, especially when defining UI components.

#### 4. State and Props

React components can have state, which represents data that can change over time. Props, short for properties, are used to pass data from parent to child components. Understanding how to manage state and props is crucial for building dynamic and interactive React applications.

#### 5. Lifecycle Methods

React components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into different stages of a component's life, such as when it is initialized, rendered, updated, or destroyed. These methods can be used to perform tasks like fetching data, setting up event listeners, or cleaning up resources.

#### 6. Hooks

Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing class components. They provide a more functional approach to working with state and side effects, making code more concise and easier to understand.

#### 7. Context

React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It is often used for providing theme information, user authentication, or other global data that needs to be accessible to many components in an application.
